## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Graduate Research Assistant, Oregon State University
(2022 - 2025)

- Conducted advanced data extraction and processing by creating complex SQL queries to analyze and manage extensive datasets of malicious files.
- Pioneered the development of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methodologies, designed to detect and cluster real-time SWAT data for stream temperature.
- Successfully executed data retrieval tasks, involving over 100 million records of stream temperature data, utilizing BigQuery and effectively stored the data in a GCP cloud storage database.
- Demonstrated strong programming skills by constructing a Python-based pipeline to develop a sophisticated clustering-based algorithm to identify high-temperature stream areas.
Leveraged machine learning classifiers to annotate and identify census tracts with historical evidence of evacuation during previous floods in Oregon.

### Data Scientist, Kobo360 Logistics Company 
(2021 – 2022)
- Spearheaded data collection and rigorous data cleansing efforts for transport data across six African countries within Kobo360's operational scope.
- Employed AWS Redshift for the efficient ingestion of meticulously cleaned data into the database, supporting data analysis endeavors.
- Applied advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to conduct in-depth data analysis, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the transportation industry.
- Developed and fine-tuned supervised predictive models to calculate trip prices based on an array of metrics and features, enhancing pricing accuracy.
